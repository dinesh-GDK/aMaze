# aMaze!

**aMaze** is a web application that comprises of a various maze generators as well as various maze solvers. You can create and solve the mazes by using the available algorithms or you can play and solve the mazes on your own.

You can access the web application [here](https://dinesh-gdk.github.io/aMaze).

## Maze Generation
There are three algorithms to craete mazez.
- Recursive Division
- Randomized Kruskal's Algorithm
- Randomized Prim's Algorithm

## Maze Solvers
There are four algorithms to solve mazes.
- Depth-first Search
- Breadth-first Search
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- A* Search

You can also see how the algorithms explore and solve the mazes.
