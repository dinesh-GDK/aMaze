# aMaze!

**aMaze** is a web application that comprises of a maze generator as well as various maze solvers. You can create random mazes, play, and solve the mazes or you can choose an algorithm to solve the mazes for you.

You can access the web application [here](https://dinesh-gdk.github.io/aMaze).

## Maze Generation
The mazes in **aMaze** are created by a modified version of **Randomized Prim's algorithm**.

## Maze Solvers
Currently, there are two algorithms to solve mazes.
- Depth-first search
- Breadth-first search

You can also see how the algorithms explore and solve the mazes.
